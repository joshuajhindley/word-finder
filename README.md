This repo contains the source code for a tool that helps in finding the correct word in a Wordle game.
<br>
This project was a solo project worked on by me (Joshua Hindley) between March and May of 2022.
<br>
This tool is hosted on my website and can be accessed at [hindley.me/word-finder](https://hindley.me/word-finder).
